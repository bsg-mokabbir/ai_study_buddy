    "# 🎉 Tutorial Complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built a complete AI Study Buddy application from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Text-Only Chatbot\n",
    "- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Created a flexible config system\n",
    "- ✅ **Educational Prompts**: Designed prompts for educational interactions\n",
    "- ✅ **OpenAI Integration**: Connected to OpenAI's text generation API\n",
    "- ✅ **Conversation Management**: Built a chatbot with memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Image Generation\n",
    "- ✅ **Multimodal Capabilities**: Extended to support both text and images\n",
    "- ✅ **Intent Detection**: Automatically detected image vs text requests\n",
    "- ✅ **DALL-E Integration**: Added image generation with DALL-E 3\n",
    "- ✅ **Enhanced Responses**: Created rich response objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Web Interface\n",
    "- ✅ **Streamlit Integration**: Built a complete web interface\n",
    "- ✅ **Interactive UI**: Added sidebar controls and example questions\n",
    "- ✅ **Image Display**: Handled image rendering in the web interface\n",
    "- ✅ **Session Management**: Maintained conversation state across interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Key Features Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Educational Focus**: Specialized prompts for learning\n",
    "2. **Subject Awareness**: Different approaches for different subjects\n",
    "3. **Multimodal Responses**: Both text explanations and visual aids\n",
    "4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive web interface\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallbacks\n",
    "6. **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across interactions\n",
    "7. **Example Questions**: Pre-built questions to get users started\n",
    "8. **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time conversation statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this project further, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add More Subjects**: Expand the educational prompts\n",
    "2. **Implement Quizzes**: Add interactive quiz generation\n",
    "3. **File Upload**: Allow students to upload homework for help\n",
    "4. **Voice Integration**: Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech\n",
    "5. **Progress Tracking**: Track learning progress over time\n",
    "6. **Multi-Language**: Support multiple languages\n",
    "7. **Advanced Styling**: Enhance the UI with custom themes\n",
    "8. **Database Integration**: Store conversations and user progress\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Code Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial follows the same modular architecture as the main project:\n",
